# Course Summary

## Skills
This class has enabled me to take the unstructured mess of language and make educated attempts at understanding it using the structure of computer systems. Throughout the class, I learned techniques to tokenize, understand, and learn from textual data, enabling me to build a chatbot that can understand and respond to user input. The information retrieval techniques I picked up inspired me to consider a future semantic search project. I also learned how to read and critique research papers, which is a skill that will be useful in my future career as a software engineer.

## Enthusiasm
I was excited to take this class because I have always been interested in the intersection of language and technology. I have always been fascinated by the way that language can be used to communicate complex ideas, and I was excited to learn how to use computers to understand and manipulate language. I was also excited to learn about the applications of natural language processing, especially systems like ChatGPT and GPT-3 that can generate text that is indistinguishable from human writing. The material in this course has only deepened my interest in the field; I am excited to continue learning about natural language processing and to apply the skills I have learned in this class to future projects.

## Plans for Future Learning
- Explore more advanced vectorization techniques, such as using language models to produce document vectors that capture semantic meaning
- Develop a semantic search engine that can return results based on the meaning of the query, rather than just the words in the query
- Focus on connecting open data sources such as Wikidata to build more advanced chatbots that can answer questions about a wide variety of topics
- Learn about transformers and how they revolutionized the field of natural language processing

## Future Career Plans
One of the problems I aimed to work on even before this class was developing methods to utilize ML at scale. I would like to continue to explore career opportunities in that field if possible as an ML Engineer.
